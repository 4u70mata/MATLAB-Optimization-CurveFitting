## Introduction

This project focuses on familiarizing users with new MATLAB functions for curve fitting and optimization. The main objectives are:

1. **Curve Fitting**: Using the `lsqcurvefit` function in Exercise 1 to solve nonlinear curve fitting problems.
2. **Linear Optimization**: Applying the `linprog` function in Exercise 2 for linear optimization tasks.
3. **Nonlinear Optimization**: Utilizing the `fmincon` function in Exercise 3 for nonlinear optimization scenarios.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- **Cmin.m**: Contains code related to specific computations or minimization tasks.
- **fun.m**: Defines a function used in the context of curve fitting or optimization.
- **fun1.m**: Another function that may support various calculations or optimizations.
- **nonlincontraint.m**: Implements nonlinear constraints for optimization problems.
- **TP4.m**: Main script that orchestrates the execution of the exercises and functions.
- **TP4_Sami_Aridal.pdf**: A document providing details, results, and insights from the project.

## Usage

To run the project, execute the `TP4.m` script in MATLAB. Ensure that all files are in the same directory for proper functionality.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (R2020a or later recommended)
- Required toolboxes: Optimization Toolbox
